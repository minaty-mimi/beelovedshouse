## 📊 REAL-TIME FEATURES EXPLAINED

### How Real-time Works:
1. **User adds to cart** → Saves to Supabase → All devices see it instantly
2. **Admin deletes product** → Supabase notifies all users → Product disappears everywhere
3. **Someone signs up for newsletter** → Admin dashboard shows +1 immediately
4. **Order placed** → Admin sees it in real-time without refresh

### Powered by:
- Supabase Realtime (PostgreSQL Change Data Capture)
- WebSocket connections
- Automatic subscriptions in `AppContext.tsx`

---

## 🛠️ ADMIN FEATURES

### Product Management
```typescript
// Delete Product
deleteProduct(productId) // Works now!

// Add Product
addProduct({ title, price, image, ... })

// Update Product
updateProduct(productId, { price: newPrice })
```

### Real-time Dashboard
- Orders appear instantly when customers checkout
- Newsletter signups show immediately
- Inventory updates sync across all admins
- Low stock alerts in real-time
